I have identified and corrected a bug in the `PerformanceChart` component that was causing the charts to not be populated correctly. The issue was that the chart was using a mix of filtered and unfiltered data, which caused a mismatch and prevented it from rendering. I have adjusted the code to ensure that all parts of the chart use the same filtered data. This should resolve the issue, and the charts should now display the correct information.
